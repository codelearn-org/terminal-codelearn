*** FIXED:  On all platforms,  siege is experiencing race conditions 
    in SSL; please look for a future fix.

*** On AIX,  the native compiler is supported.  It currently doesn't 
    work with gcc, appears to be a linking issue. 

*** On rare occasions, the application doesn't quit and it has to be
    killed, "killall -9 siege".  Update: Jan 22, 2002, the condition
    on which siege refuses to die is even rarer, but still exists. A
    race condition of unknow origin.  Update: Feb 03, 2002, this may
    be fixed as a result of the connection timeout mechanism.
    Update: Feb 21, 2002, this problem may have been  corrected with 
    with the socket timeouts in http.c

*** Support for clients  > 1000 is limited on most platforms without 
    OS tweaking on the part of the  end user.  (That would be you :) 
    Start with a much smaller number (50) and work your way up....
