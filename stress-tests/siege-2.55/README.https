Siege 1.10  introduced  https  protocol support.  To enable HTTPS
you  will  have  to  download  OpenSSL < http://www.openssl.org >
to  enable  Secure Socket Layers  and  install it on your system. 
Please consult the  OpenSSL documentation for  configuration  and
installation instructions. Once it is installed, you are ready to 
build siege with https support.


----------------------------IMPORTANT---------------------------- 
ATTENTION:  If you already  have  siege  installed on your system 
and you want to enable https support, you will have to remove the
previous version  before  continuing.  If you  have  the original 
source directory, the simplest way to remove siege is:
 
 $ make uninstall

If  not then you will have to remove it manually. It is important
that  you  removed the siege binary as well as the libraries.  To 
remove siege: 

 $ cd PREFIX/bin

[ by default /usr/local/bin ] and remove siege:

 $rm siege

Next you will have to remove the libraries:

 $ cd PREFIX/lib

[ by default /usr/local/lib ] and remove the libraries:

 $ rm libsiege*
 $ rm libjoedog* 

To build siege with HTTPS protocol support consult the document 
INSTALL in this directory.  For the impatient: 

 $ ./configure --prefix=/some/dir --with-ssl=/dir/with/ssl 
 $ make
 $ make install

If you've installed openssl in the default directory,  then the 
directory parameter is /usr/local/ssl.  The configure script is
designed  to scan  several common installation paths if it does
not find ssl in the directory that you've indicated.
